# CoExpression_Networks


## Hey look, I found a link to some pre-created co-expression networks for the human post-mortem DLPFC:
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7187666
... but double check their publication, because I believe they removed "surrogate variables" before creating this, which makes me pretty nervous.

## Even better: co-expression networks generated from the freshly-resected human hippocampus, which were also compared to the post-mortem human hippocampus and mouse.
Here's the paper:
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v19/n2/full/nn.4205.html
The coexpression modules (all nodes - no edges) are in the supplementary tables (S2).
I don't see any for the mouse - too bad!


## General network creation (includes data from co-expression and protein-protein interaction experiments):

### FunCoup includes a wide variety of evidence-types:

### Coexpressdb focuses just on standard co-expression and protein-protein interaction data:

### Mouse hippocampal and amygdala co-expression networks... but they only provide the nodal genes for 3 modules in the supplementary section. Jerks.
