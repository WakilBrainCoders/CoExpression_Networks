# CoExpression_Networks


## Hey look, I found a link to some pre-created co-expression networks for the human post-mortem DLPFC:
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7187666
... but double check their publication, because I believe they removed "surrogate variables" before creating this, which makes me pretty nervous.
Since this data is from post-mortem samples, the main sources of variation the data are likely to relate to dissection and how people died. Therefore, co-expression networks are likely to reflect cell type and perhaps age/health/metabolism/hypoxia.

## Even better: co-expression networks generated from a large sample of freshly-resected human hippocampus (n>100), which were also compared to the post-mortem human hippocampus and mouse.
Here's the paper:
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v19/n2/full/nn.4205.html
The coexpression modules (all nodes - no edges) are in the supplementary tables (S2).
Since this data is from freshly-resected human samples, the main source of variation will probably be related to dissection and pathology (but they tried to remove the variation related to pathology). Therefore, these co-expression networks probably strongly reflect cell type and anatomy.

## Oh awesome: I just found co-expression networks created from a large sample of fresh mouse tissue for the hippocampus and striatum (n=100) too... which are then related back to strain-related differences in conditioned fear responses (yesss....):

... and apparently one of the co-authors is my old housemate's brother. How funny.


## General network creation (includes data from co-expression and protein-protein interaction experiments):

### FunCoup includes a wide variety of evidence-types:

### Coexpressdb focuses just on standard co-expression and protein-protein interaction data:

### Mouse hippocampal and amygdala co-expression networks... but they only provide the nodal genes for 3 modules in the supplementary section. Jerks.
